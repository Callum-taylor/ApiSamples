ApiSamples
==========

This repository contains sample code to work with Wild Apricot public API. It is manually crafted code, which demonstrates how to work with WA API on very basic level.

Wild Apricot API specification is located on SwaggerHub: https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/WildApricot
SwaggerHub allows to download client libraries for our API in most modern programming languages. We strongly recommend to use auto-generated client libraries instead of building your own client.
